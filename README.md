# Music Router

This software is an audio player with additional functionality. It allows users to play two audio files 
simultaneously, and route them to different outputs. 
I use this in order to hear a metronome version of my track through headphones, while having a 
non-metronome version of the song play through speakers so the audience does not hear my click track.

There is a rudimentary file browser and playlist creator to save custom track listings for later use.

The software uses Electron.js, which allows developers to use web technologies to create native, 
cross-platform software.

This is a work in progress, so not all errors and vulnerabilities are fixed yet. Additionally, it is
currently designed for a very small touch screen so it may not look correct for other screen sizes.
